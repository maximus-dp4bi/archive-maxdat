These are files copied from IEPSWW101 machine.

IEPSWW101 has Pentaho Data Integration installed on it, however, I do not believe it is being run as a PDI server.  Instead there are bat files that call Kitchen.bat in order to call a kjb (Kettle Job) that then calls a ktr (Kettle Transform).

The bat, kjb, ktr were downloaded 20130312.
