<comment>We need to stage the natural keys for Region and/or State, Project, Program and Process in order to create a record in BPM_EVENT_MASTER.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For now, PROJECT_XXX AND SITE_XXX has been added as a placeholder.  The assumption is that PROGRAM can be derived from PROJECT and STATE and REGION can be derived from SITE and/or PROJECT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SITE is not included in the Ops Production Planning model.  Is this by design?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</comment>
