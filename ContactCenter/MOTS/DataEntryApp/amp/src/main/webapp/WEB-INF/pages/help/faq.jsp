<h2>AMP Data Capture Frequently Asked Questions</h2>


<h3>What does AMP stand for?</h3>

<p >AMP stands for "Analytics for Multiple Projects" and is an analytical
capability provided for cross-project reporting. </p>

<h3>When are reports due to be entered for Actuals?</h3>

<p >Actuals may be entered beginning on the first day after the
reporting period has ended. Weekly actuals are due by end-of-day on the Tuesday
following the end of the reporting period week. Monthly actuals are due by
end-of-day on the second Tuesday of the month following the reporting period
month. Due dates are pushed out by 1 day for each holiday occurring on Monday
or Tuesday of the week in which Actuals are due to be entered.</p>

<h3>When are reports due to be entered for Forecasts?</h3>

<p >Weekly forecasts are due by end-of-day on Tuesday for the reporting
period week occurring 2 weeks in the future. Monthly forecasts are due by
end-of-day on the last business day of the month prior to the start of the forecasted
reporting period month.</p>

<h3>Our Forecast has changed during the reporting period, how do I update the
Forecast information in AMP?</h3>

<p >The forecast in AMP should not be changed once the reporting
period has started unless a clerical error was discovered. If a change is
necessary, the Approver for the project can open the forecast for Re-Edit
allowing the user to make the necessary correction.</p>

<h3>If I am unable to get data for one or more metrics before the due date, can
I submit an incomplete Actuals report?</h3>

<p >Yes, check the box under the column "Not Supplied" for the
metric(s) that you are unable to gather prior to the due date and enter a
comment for each metric indicating the reason that the value is not being
supplied. Once the data is available, the report should be opened for re-edit
by the approver so the missing metrics can be entered and the report
re-submitted.</p>

<h3>I need to enter a percentage value for a metric, should I enter the
percentage value or a decimal?</h3>

<p >Percentage metrics should be entered as the percentage
value. For example, 87.25% should be entered as 87.25, not .8725.</p>

<h3>The Actuals/Forecast form list metrics that my project is unable to
provide. Should I select "Not Supplied" if my project does not have the
information?</h3>

<p >Your project has been configured only for metrics that are
expected to be provided. "Not Supplied" should only be selected when a temporary
or system issue is preventing you from gathering the information needed. If you
believe a metric is listed incorrectly or is missing from the form, please contact
your AMP representative or email <a href="mailto:amp@maximus.com">amp@maximus.com</a>
with details of your issue.</p>

<h3>The Actuals/Forecast form is missing one or more metrics that my project is
able to provide. How do I get the missing metric added to the form?</h3>

<p >Contact your AMP representative or email <a
href="mailto:amp@maximus.com">amp@maximus.com</a> with details of missing
metric(s).</p>

<h3>Why is the reporting period that is due not listed when I create new
Actuals/Forecasts?</h3>

<p >The report for that period may have already been created or
may not yet be valid for selection. For Actuals, a reporting period is not
displayed until the day following the last day of the reporting period.</p>

<h3>Where can I find a list of metric definitions and examples?</h3>

<p >Click "Help" in the menu at the top of the screen and select
"Metrics" for a detailed list of all metrics and definitions. Additionally you
can find specific metric definitions by clicking the information icon next to
the metric name on the data entry form.</p>

<h3>I need to add a user to AMP Data Capture as my backup. How do I add a user
to AMP Data Capture?</h3>

<p >Contact us at <a href="mailto:amp@maximus.com">amp@maximus.com</a></p>

<h3>I have a question or issue that is not answered in this list. Who can I
contact?</h3>
