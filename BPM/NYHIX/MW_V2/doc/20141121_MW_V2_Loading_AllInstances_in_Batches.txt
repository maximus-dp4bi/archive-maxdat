Description: This is the sequence of steps we employed to load around 2.3 million instances of MW into MW V2.
This global control is used in the Insert new instances ktr.
*/
Step-1: Loading in-process instances only.
update corp_etl_list_lkup
   set out_var = 'and not exists (select 1 from step_instance_stg sis where task_id = sis.step_instance_id and sis.status = ''COMPLETED'')'
  where name = 'MW_V2_ADD_TO_WHERE_CLAUSE';
  commit;


Step-2: After successful validation of In-process instances, loading completed instances in batches of two months. September and later
update corp_etl_list_lkup
   set out_var = 'and exists (select 1 from step_instance_stg sis where task_id = sis.step_instance_id and sis.status = ''COMPLETED'' and COMPLETED_TS >= to_date(''09/01/2014 00:00:00'',''mm/dd/yyyy hh24:mi:ss''))'
  where name = 'MW_V2_ADD_TO_WHERE_CLAUSE';
  commit;

Step-3: After successful validation of all the instances loaded so far, loading completed instances in batches of two months. Jul and later
update corp_etl_list_lkup
   set out_var = 'and exists (select 1 from step_instance_stg sis where task_id = sis.step_instance_id and sis.status = ''COMPLETED'' and COMPLETED_TS >= to_date(''07/01/2014 00:00:00'',''mm/dd/yyyy hh24:mi:ss''))'
  where name = 'MW_V2_ADD_TO_WHERE_CLAUSE';
  commit;

step-4: get all recs that were never processed, i.e, SIS.MW_V2_Processed=’N’.
update corp_etl_list_lkup
   set out_var = null
  where name = 'MW_V2_ADD_TO_WHERE_CLAUSE';
  commit;
