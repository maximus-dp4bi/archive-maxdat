Description:
There is one instance in TX MEA ETL that was stuck since 12-May. This is happening due to the Complete_dt being before the Create_dt. As per Steven, this is 
a corner case and we need to perform below going forward.

Below is from Steven Davis on 06/20: BUSINESS RULE CHANGE FOR CORNER CASES.
For the corner case in general I think we need to create a JIRA and add logic to this rule for ased wait for fee and complete date to use selection recd date 
only when the fee recd date is prior to creation Â¿ this is happening when we redocument the case for enrollment but they have already paid / have account credit 
and the record of the payment is prior to the creation of the new instance.
