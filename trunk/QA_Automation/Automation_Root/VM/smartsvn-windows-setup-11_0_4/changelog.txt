Fixed
-----
- Commit dialog, Differences pane: shortcuts for the built-in compare did not work
- Conflict Solver: ${baseFile} was not set for merge conflicts of binary files
- Edit | Customize, Context Menus: right context menu did not work
- error handling: certain SVN-related errors might be reported as internal error
- Revision Graph, Merge Arrows: possible internal error when encountering bad svn:mergeinfo positions
- Linux launcher: smartsvn.sh did not parse $SMARTSVN_CONFIG_DIR/smartsvn.vmoptions

Other Noteworthy Changes
------------------------
- Repository URL input field: Shift+Del deletes entries (similar to Chrome) - instead of plain Del


SmartSVN 11.0.3 (2019-06-28)
============================
Fixed
-----
- Commit dialog: does not restore exact position
- macOS: possible internal error when a speed-search popup is open and a global
  accelerators is pressed
- Filter input field is too small

SmartSVN 11.0.2 (2019-05-13)
============================
New, Improved
-------------
- Tag/Branch browser: remembers sorting columns
- Linux: additional debian bundle

Fixed
-----
- Merge dialog: too much branches could cause internal error because of too
  many created MenuItems
- Project Settings, Change Root Path dialog: random order of dropped
  directories
- Linux: internal error if "xim"is configured for GTK_IM_MODULE
- macOS: .dmg could not be read on macOS 10.11
- Windows:
    - Shell integration: states may be confused by running SmartSVN instance
    - Shell integration/status case: possible problems (flickering or no
      indexing in ignored parent directory, no display of unversioned
      directories)

Other Noteworthy Changes
------------------------
- Linux: the launcher now uses a login shell, so all paths and environment
  variables you configure there also apply for SmartSVN
- documented how to get SmartSVN starting on Fedora 30+ (requires
  libxcrypt-compat)


SmartSVN 11.0.1 (2019-02-27)
============================
Fixed
-----
- Compare:
    - apply selection: possible internal error applying changes from inserted
      block
- Linux: settings are copied from wrong location; to fix, exit SmartSVN 11,
  delete ~/.config/smartsvn/11, restart SmartSVN 11
- macOS 10.14: duplicate toolbar item after configuring toolbar
- UI:
    - Changes view: scrolling with mouse wheel over connector scrolls to next
      tabbed view
    - Configure Tag-Branch-Layout dialog can get too wide for long URLs
    - restoring maximized view by double-clicking title bar restores older size
    - message dialog: buttons move to right after each Windows screen lock
    - preferences: proxy port is not remembered
    - tab order cycles between table and search input field

SmartSVN 11 RC 1 (2018-11-12)
=============================
New, Improved
-------------
- Commit:
    - committing to an external with fixed revision optionally increases
      the external revision
    - Spell checker: ability to trigger suggestion popup with keyboard
- Repository Browser:
    - Edit Properties: is now only available if HEAD revision is showing
    - Move: is now only available if HEAD revision is showing

Fixed
-----
- Compare:
    - with "Ignore All Whitespaces" selected, blocks may show up as
      completely modified instead of not showing them at all
- Externals, Edit: revision chooser did not work for URLs containing
  special characters like '['
- Repository Browser:
    - Copy: did not honor option to reset to HEAD revision
- Refresh:
    - external's bugtraq properties get cleared on subsequent refreshs
- Status cache was broken
- GUI:
    - Customize accelerators: could remove all accelerators from
      invisible (filtered-out) menu items
    - wizards did not show borders
    - tree controls (e.g. directory views): double-clicking outside a
      node did not change the selection but triggered a command on the
      selection
- macOS 10.14: better looking border colors

Other Noteworthy Changes
------------------------
- SVN 1.11.0
=> renamed SmartSVN to version 11
- updated macOS and Linux bundles to JRE 10, too (JRE 11 is still too
  buggy)


SmartSVN 10 preview 2 (2018-10-08)
==================================
New, Improved
-------------
- Binary file detection: on Windows the case is now ignored for the
  patterns, so *.pdf also matches foo.PDF

      compare on files considered too large
- Changes view, Compare:
    - select lines using the line number gutter

      filter input field

      field
    - Customize | Accelerators: replaced speed-search with filter input
      field
- Linux: support for XDG_*_HOME environment variables
    => the settings directory now is $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/smartsvn (if
       XDG_CONFIG_HOME is unset, $HOME/.config is used)
- Windows: supports SASL

Fixed
-----
- Commit:
    - file name completion: performance problem for large number of
      files
- Compare, Conflict Solver:
    - internal error deleting/replacing all text
    - line number gutter did not resize, e.g. when adding one line in a
      file with 99 lines
- Conflict Solver:
    - inline changes did not show up correctly for left-middle blocks
- docking: some drag and drop fixes
- error dialog:
    - preserves line endings in error messages (instead of replacing
      them by spaces)
    - more details, e.g. in cases where SASL failed
- refresh (macOS): failed to pick up directory renames
- GUI:
    - Directory tree: sometimes the selection was cut-off
    - Filter input field did not handle Ctrl+Backspace
    - Find Command: workaround for bug
      https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=537417
    - macOS: showing a context menu while one already was showing caused
      an empty context menu to occur
- macOS 10.14 (Mojave): work-around for bug
  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=539693 causing internal
  error in Log or Revision Graph

      app window)
  - Linux:
    - GTK3 automatically maximized windows trying to restore nearly
      full-screen size
    - several theme related colors fixed
  - Windows: right-aligned table column header lacks margin

Other Noteworthy Changes
------------------------
- large tooltips show single-line by default and can be deactivated at all
  (tooltip.compactLineLimit, tooltip.enabled)
- rewritten tab folder controls (Windows, Linux) -> this got themable
