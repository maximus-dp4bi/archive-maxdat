USER STORY One Time Historical Load Enhancements PAIEB


REVIEW CURRENT PAIEB CODE IN svn://svn-staging.maximus.com/dev1d/maxdat/trunk/Kettle8/PAIESNFLK8
For job 8, it is taking 3 hours â€“ split it to 3 jobs.
Inside Step_instance load, had to hard code the Slice From-To IDs to quickly deploy.
Use svn://svn-staging.maximus.com/dev1d/maxdat/trunk/Kettle8/PAIESNFLK8/data/config/QueryToSliceStep_instance.txt to dynamically slice.


4. Move the code to permanent Prod server. Work with Lavanya to figure out the server details. This will exist as failsafe code with AWS/DMS is down.


ACCEPTANCE 

PAIEB_OneTime_Loads_8 has been split into 3 jobs
QueryToSliceStep_instance.txt is dynamic
The above is deployed to prod

I see on UVACPMMETL01MXD the PAIESNFLK8 scripts installed under 
/u01/maximus/maxdat-prd/PAIESNFLK8/scripts/main/transforms

I see development on ucocdmmetl01mxd.maxcorp.maximus 
under /u01/maximus/maxdat-dev/PAIESNFLK8/scripts/main/bin

Is that accurate? 
I can't find load8 any where. 

I need the details of the UAT and Development environments to work in? 
databases where Snowflake is installed ?
